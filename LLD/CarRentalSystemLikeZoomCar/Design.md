Certainly! Hereâ€™s a **Low-Level Design (LLD)** for a **Car Rental System** like ZoomCar, focusing on the main entities and their relationships.

## **Entities & Relationships**

### 1. **User**
Represents a customer using the system.
````java
public class User {
    private int userId;
    private String name;
    private String email;
    private String licenseNumber;
    // ...other details
}
````

---

### 2. **Car**
Represents a car available for rent.
````java
public class Car {
    private int carId;
    private String registrationNumber;
    private CarType type;
    private CarStatus status; // AVAILABLE, BOOKED, MAINTENANCE
    private Location location;
    private double pricePerHour;
    // ...other details
}
````

````java
public enum CarType {
    HATCHBACK, SEDAN, SUV, LUXURY
}

public enum CarStatus {
    AVAILABLE, BOOKED, MAINTENANCE
}
````

---

### 3. **Location**
Represents a pickup/drop location.
````java
public class Location {
    private int locationId;
    private String city;
    private String address;
    // ...other details
}
````

---

### 4. **Booking**
Represents a car booking by a user.
````java
public class Booking {
    private int bookingId;
    private User user;
    private Car car;
    private Location pickupLocation;
    private Location dropLocation;
    private Date startTime;
    private Date endTime;
    private BookingStatus status; // CONFIRMED, CANCELLED, COMPLETED
    private Payment payment;
    // ...other details
}
````

````java
public enum BookingStatus {
    CONFIRMED, CANCELLED, COMPLETED
}
````

---

### 5. **Payment**
Represents payment details for a booking.
````java
public class Payment {
    private int paymentId;
    private double amount;
    private PaymentStatus status; // PENDING, COMPLETED, FAILED
    private Date paymentDate;
    // ...other details
}
````

````java
public enum PaymentStatus {
    PENDING, COMPLETED, FAILED
}
````

---

## **Core Services/Methods**

### **CarRentalService**
````java
public class CarRentalService {
    private List<Car> cars;
    private List<User> users;
    private List<Location> locations;
    private List<Booking> bookings;

    // Search available cars by location, type, and time
    public List<Car> searchCars(Location location, CarType type, Date start, Date end) { /* ... */ }

    // Book a car
    public Booking bookCar(User user, Car car, Location pickup, Location drop, Date start, Date end) { /* ... */ }

    // Cancel a booking
    public boolean cancelBooking(int bookingId) { /* ... */ }

    // View user bookings
    public List<Booking> getUserBookings(User user) { /* ... */ }
}
````
